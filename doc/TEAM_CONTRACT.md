## Team Procedures

### Team meetings
* when and how often to meet (at least once a week)
  https://www.when2meet.com/?13517544-y7zZX fill this out!!!
  Sunday evening for 2 hours

* how to communicate action items made during the meeting

Take notes during meetings, with to dos. Also, keep a master list of what everyone is working on at any given time.

* policy for a team member to give advance notice of missing a team meeting and work required to make up for it

Preferably they should notify the team within a few hours of the meeting. However, we understand that unexpected things come up, so we understand if a team member gives shorter notice occasionally. There is no work required to make up for missing a team meeting, just getting the work done that they said they would. They would also be responsible for sending updates, and for reading over the meeting notes and asking questions if they need to.

* policy for handling disagreements, major decisions, or priorities during the meeting

When handling a disagreement, we should get input from all involved parties. Then, we should try to reach consensus, but in the event we cannot after putting in a significant amount of time, we should take a vote. This is the same way we should handle major decisions. We should handle priorities in the meetings by first discussing what we need to cover in the meeting, then prioritizing those things and going over them in order of priority.


### Communications
* decision-making policy: consensus if possible, majority vote otherwise.
* preferred channel of communication: text
* response policy: respond within 24 hours. If the deadline is coming up, be as available as possible until the deadline.
* policy for keeping everyone up-to-date on major decisions, changes, or updates: only make major decisions where a full group (or subgroup, like backend) is available. Update everyone else after via text.

### Helping each other
* how and when to ask for help and what is needed to show effort
* First Google, then ask team member doing same work (e.g. back end asks back end), then ask general team.
* try to ask in advance rather than close to deadline
* response to team member asking for help: try to help out teammates if you are knowledgeable
* Focus on implementing your own tasks then look for ways to help/support others

### Commitments
* What does it mean to work to the “best of your ability”
* Constantly work to improve and grow as a coder
* how to set internal deadlines
* Set internal deadlines at weekly meetings that relate to class deadlines. Individuals will be expected to make personal deadlines as well.
* how to provide commitments others on the team can rely on:
  *let other members know about big exams/projects in other class that might interfere with fulfilling commitments to this project asap
* Policy for resolving failure to meet commitments: same as policy on breaking promises from the first section. To restate:
    * have a team meeting and ask the person to follow this agreement
* report the issue in the Team Sprint Report
* reach out to Duvall if there are repeated incidents
