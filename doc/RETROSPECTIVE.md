# Lab Retrospective Discussion

### Kat Cottrell, Dane Erickson, Dania Fernandez, Evan Kenyon, Asher Early, Michelle Zhang

## Project's current progress

* Evan: behind
* Michelle: behind
* Kat: behind
* Dania: behind
* Dane: behind
* Asher: behind

## Current level of communication

* **Evan:** too much, but I think we recognized that and shifted towards less. Overall, respectful
  discussions and everyone is clearly invested in having good communication.
* **Dania:** Consistent, reliable replies from team members. Had open discussions about expectations
  for modifying each other’s code. Had multiple in person meetings.
* **Michelle:** Pretty decent, we have also developed ground rules for situations that caused
  misunderstandings, like asking for permission before changing code and pulling and merging often.
* **Kat:** Pretty good, occasional misunderstandings but they are generally clarified without hurt
  feelings. Have agreed to stay in contact if we want to modify others’ code and be available for
  questions regarding our roles and code.
* **Dane:** Good conversation among team members through the group chat and in meetings. It is
  slightly challenging to meet as a whole team since we have so many people, but we have done a good
  job of updating everyone about the meetings for those that couldn’t attend.
* **Asher:**  Solid but too design-oriented. We’ve tended to spend more time discussing and
  re-discussing high-level design decisions and have fallen behind on implementation.

## Satisfaction with team roles

* Evan: satisfied
* Michelle: satisfied
* Kat: Very happy!
* Dania: satisfied
* Dane: satisfied
* Asher: Satisfied

## Teamwork that worked well

* Thing #1
    * We resolved conflicts quickly by communicating clearly and establishing new rules that
      addressed those conflicts.

* Thing #2
    * We held a successful Zoom meeting, starting with a centralized group meeting with all six of
      us and then breaking out into smaller specialty groups and returning to the main room to
      discuss questions between specialists.

## Teamwork that could be improved

* Thing #1
    * We can do a better job of setting small deadlines for finishing your code. We did a great job
      planning overall design but had some problems pushing off actually writing the code.

* Thing #2
    * Focusing on simplest version of deliverable, so that we don’t have to sit with abstract design
      thoughts of future implementation goals.

## Teamwork to improve next Sprint

* Establish earlier on and more specifically how the controller, model, and view will be
  communicating with each other for each part of the project. Be in agreement about what will be
  called and passed between components so that time is not wasted towards the end editing methods so
  that components fit together.
