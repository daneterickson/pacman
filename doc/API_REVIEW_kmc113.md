## Lab Exercise : OOGA API Review
### Kat Cottrell [kmc113], working with Haseeb Chaudhry [hac21]

Haseeb is on team 4, and created a digital version of checkers.  He told me about his team's API, which was cool because even though checkers is ostensibly a very different type of game from Pac Man, our APIs still bore a deal of semblance.  We both used steps to play through the game sequences, and used checkers to update and keep track of important changes like lost pieces and wins and losses.  We also both followed the model-controller-view system encouraged in class, which makes sense because we both learned these things here.  I was impressed by the extensibility of Haseeb's design to other games like chess--he described a hypothetical where, with the addition of a new set of rules and the assignment of weights to particular pieces, chess could be simulated from the same program.  His design was also very flexible to different parameters like number of players etc.
