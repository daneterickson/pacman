## Implementation Plan (doc/plan/SPRINT_PLAN.md)
Describe your plan for how to manage and prioritize the project that describes the APIs each team member plans to take primary and secondary responsibility for and a rough timeline of how the team will order the work to complete the program. Specifically, each person should take responsibility for specific features and Use Cases they intend to work on during each Sprint (i.e., each week). This requires the team to agree on the feature priorities and set goals for what to complete for each deliverable.
### WEEK 2 (11/15)
TEST: implement the team's planned first release features, focusing on a simple, testable, core
* Basic pacman with functioning score counter, and maze with dots, a single ghost, win and loss conditions. 
* Evan
* Dania
* Kat: Make button panel and event handlers for all buttons
* Dane: Make the Board, with Pac Man, walls, dots, and ghosts
* Asher: Implement classes concerning ghosts as well as AI subclasses for ghosts
* Michelle: Implement classes concerning Agent, Controllable, Moveable, Consumable Interfaces to power basic Pac man movement, and eating dots.
### WEEK 3 (11/22)
BASIC: implement the team's planned second release features, implementing most of the basic features
* Features from TEST + all 4 ghosts, user preferences, save and load game, multiple games at once.
* Evan
* Dania
* Kat: Make languages and view themes/modes
* Dane: Add dots of different values, fruit, and ghosts changing from non-consumable to consumable. Make user control Ghosts instead of Pac Man and add view items for Super Pac Man.
* Asher: Add functionality to accomodate implementation of GhostPlayer and Super pacman game
* Michelle: Add functionality to classes implementing Agent, Controllable, Moveable, Consumable Interfaces to support our other 2 example games.
### WEEK 4 (11/29)
COMPLETE: implement the team's complete functionality, focusing on the challenge features
* Features from BASIC + settings for ARTIFICIAL PLAYERS (ghost algorithm/hardness) + start GAME DATA PRODUCER AND VIEWER (game stats)
* Evan
* Dania
* Kat
* Dane: Create Popup for statistics tracking for different methods.
* Asher: Focus on refactoring model to support good design
* Michelle: Engine support for collecting data for stats and delivering them in a feasible data structure to Data to be stored in a file to support future review and comparison.
### WEEK 5 (12/6)
DEMO: create additional example data files and record a demo of the games chosen to show off your design's flexibility
* Debug, finalize, previous code + create additional example data files for mods, Ghost player mode, and Super Pacman mode.
* Evan
* Dania
* Kat
* Dane: Finish debugging and add pop ups for errors in data files
* Asher
* Michelle: Finish up debugging and finalizing classes concerning Agent, Controllable, Moveable, Consumable Interfaces to ensure that they can support the additional example data files created.
